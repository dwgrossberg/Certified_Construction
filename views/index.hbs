      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Certified Construction, a construction management company with a
        workforce of 200 employees, specializes in a variety of sectors
        including architecture, design, and project management, and reports
        annual revenue exceeding $75 million. In such a multidisciplinary field,
        the company must maintain rigorous compliance with industry
        certifications, a complex task considering each employee holds an
        average of five certifications with varying validity periods and
        mandatory renewal training sessions, cumulatively numbering over 1,000
        sessions each year. A database-driven website is essential to
        efficiently manage this multitude of certifications and training
        requirements, automate reminders for upcoming expirations, streamline
        the tracking of completed and scheduled training sessions, and ensure no
        lapse in qualifications. This system will support Certified Construction
        in optimizing operational efficiency, maintaining regulatory compliance,
        and enhancing productivity, all of which are critical to sustaining
        their market position and delivering projects on time to their
        clientele.</p>
